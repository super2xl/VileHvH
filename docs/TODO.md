- [ ] Test on Windows system
- [ ] Verify Metamod/SourceMod URLs are current
- [ ] Confirm HvH-gg plugin requirements
- [ ] Database preferences for rank system
- [ ] Desired plugin features

## Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Python Standard Library Only**: Keep dependencies minimal for easier deployment
- **Modular Design**: Each component is self-contained and reusable
- **Cross-Platform**: Support Windows and Linux equally (macOS later if needed)
- **Logging First**: Everything important should be logged

### Plugin Management Considerations
- Plugins can have complex dependencies
- Some plugins need gamedata files
- Some plugins need config files
- Version compatibility is crucial
- Need to handle both .smx and .sp files

### Database for Ranks
- Need to decide: SQLite (easier) vs MySQL (more powerful)
- Consider using an ORM for easier database operations
- Need migration system for schema updates
- Consider connection pooling for performance

### Future Architecture
- Consider adding a web UI using Flask or FastAPI
- Could use React/Vue for frontend
- Could add REST API for remote management
- Could add WebSocket for real-time server monitoring
